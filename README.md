# Software Engineering

## What is software engineering?

Software engineering is to select and apply flexibly a (non-standard and fully customizable) set of methodologies based on experience and intuition to develop software systems.

## Purpose

Software engineering aims to develop software-based systems systematically and efficiently that let customers achieve business goals.

## Decisive methodological factors

- Traceability
- Testing
- Measurement
- Security

### Traceability

Indicate clearly the relationship between requirements, user cases (user stories), concepts (objects), and implementation (codes).

### Testing

Test-Driven Development - start a test plan before developing to ensure the correctness (rather than quality)

### Measurement

For estimation, planning, and system quality assessment

### Security

Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) combines software development and security development. 

Functional security features include
- Cryptography
- Key distribution
- Firewalls
- Default security configuration
- Privilege separation
- Patch quality and response time.

## Difficulties

- Software is abstract and intangible
- Require problem domain (aka application domain) knowledge.
