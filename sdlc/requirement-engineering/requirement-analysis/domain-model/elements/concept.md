# Concepts of A System

## Concept types

- worker: thing or person is responsible for a particular task
- thing: thing contains information or to be information itself

## Concept classifiers

- boundary: things interact directly with users of the system
- control: the outer-most workers receive inward boundary concepts and orchestrate the jobs of inner workers (i.e., Controllers).
- entity: concrete objects of boundary-classifier or control-classifier concepts
