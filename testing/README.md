## Test case

A test case defines the expected output of the tested target when we give it a specific input.

## Test

A test is a finite set of related test cases.

## Test types

### By boundary

- White box test
  - Unit test
  - Integration test
  - System test
    - Function test
    - Quality test
- Black box test
  - Acceptance test
  - Installation test

## Test coverage

- Specification coverage
- Code coverage: measures the degree (often percentage) the source code tested

## Considerations

- Find faults as cheaply and quickly as possible.
