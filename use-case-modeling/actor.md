# Actors

An external entity, such as a person, subsystem, or system, interacts with the system-to-be. An actor is associated with a role rather than a person.

## Actor types
 
- Initiator
- [Participant](#participant-types)

A requester is an initiator and an approver is a participant.

### Participant types

- Supporting participant
- Offstage participant

An approver is a supporting participant, but an offstage participant, such as an upper manager, may want to receive request information.
